	abstract = {We propose a simple approach to bridge between portfolio theory and machine learning. The outcome is an out-of-sample machine learning eﬃcient frontier based on two assets, high risk and low risk. By rotating between the two assets, we show that the proposed frontier dominates the mean-variance eﬃcient frontier out-of-sample. Our results, therefore, shed important light on the appeal of machine learning into portfolio selection under estimation risk.},

	abstract = {We propose a new latent factor conditional asset pricing model. Like Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (KPS, 2019), our model allows for latent factors and factor exposures that depend on covariates such as asset characteristics. But, unlike the linearity assumption of KPS, we model factor exposures as a flexible nonlinear function of covariates. Our model retrofits the workhorse unsupervised dimension reduction device from the machine learning literature – autoencoder neural networks – to incorporate information from covariates along with returns themselves. This delivers estimates of nonlinear conditional exposures and the associated latent factors. Furthermore, our machine learning framework imposes the economic restriction of no-arbitrage. Our autoencoder asset pricing model delivers out-of-sample pricing errors that are far smaller (and generally insignificant) compared to other leading factor models.},

For NYSE and AMEX stock returns from 1972 to 1995, it can be used to select portfolios with significantly lower out-of-sample variance than a set of existing estimators, including multifactor models.},

This improves the eﬃciency of estimates for the latent factors and their loadings, and helps to ascertain the economic relationships among factors and individuals via the observable instruments. The estimation is fast to calculate and accommodates unbalanced panels. We show consistency and asymptotic normality under general panel data generating processes.

	abstract = {The portfolio optimization model has limited impact in practice because of estimation issues when applied to real data. To address this, we adapt two machine learning methods, regularization and cross-validation, for portfolio optimization. First, we introduce performance-based regularization (PBR), where the idea is to constrain the sample variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation (SAA) and PBR solutions and the corresponding eﬃcient frontiers. To calibrate the right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new, performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally weighted portfolio. We ﬁnd that PBR dominates all other benchmarks for two out of three Fama–French data sets.},

	abstract = {Predicting the price correlation of two assets for future time periods is important in portfolio optimization. We apply LSTM recurrent neural networks (RNN) in predicting the stock price correlation coeﬃcient of two individual stocks. RNN’s are competent in understanding temporal dependencies. The use of LSTM cells further enhances its long term predictive properties. To encompass both linearity and nonlinearity in the model, we adopt the ARIMA model as well. The ARIMA model ﬁlters linear tendencies in the data and passes on the residual value to the LSTM model. The ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model is tested against other traditional predictive ﬁnancial models such as the full historical model, constant correlation model, single-index model and the multi-group model. In our empirical study, the predictive ability of the ARIMA-LSTM model turned out superior to all other ﬁnancial models by a signiﬁcant scale. Our work implies that it is worth considering the ARIMALSTM model to forecast correlation coeﬃcient for portfolio optimization.},

This framework is realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a trading period of 30 minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high commission rate of 0.25\% in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.},

	abstract = {Asset allocation (or portfolio management) is the task of determining how to optimally allocate funds of a finite budget into a range of financial instruments/assets such as stocks. This study investigated the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) when applied to portfolio management using model-free deep RL agents. We trained several RL agents on real-world stock prices to learn how to perform asset allocation. We compared the performance of these RL agents against some baseline agents. We also compared the RL agents among themselves to understand which classes of agents performed better. From our analysis, RL agents can perform the task of portfolio management since they significantly outperformed two of the baseline agents (random allocation and uniform allocation). Four RL agents (A2C, SAC, PPO, and TRPO) outperformed the best baseline, MPT, overall. This shows the abilities of RL agents to uncover more profitable trading strategies. Furthermore, there were no significant performance differences between value-based and policy-based RL agents. Actor-critic agents performed better than other types of agents. Also, on-policy agents performed better than off-policy agents because they are better at policy evaluation and sample efficiency is not a significant problem in portfolio management. This study shows that RL agents can substantially improve asset allocation since they outperform strong baselines. On-policy, actor-critic RL agents showed the most promise based on our analysis.},
