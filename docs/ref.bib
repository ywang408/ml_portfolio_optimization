	abstract = {We propose a simple approach to bridge between portfolio theory and machine learning. The outcome is an out-of-sample machine learning eﬃcient frontier based on two assets, high risk and low risk. By rotating between the two assets, we show that the proposed frontier dominates the mean-variance eﬃcient frontier out-of-sample. Our results, therefore, shed important light on the appeal of machine learning into portfolio selection under estimation risk.},

	abstract = {We propose a new latent factor conditional asset pricing model. Like Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (KPS, 2019), our model allows for latent factors and factor exposures that depend on covariates such as asset characteristics. But, unlike the linearity assumption of KPS, we model factor exposures as a flexible nonlinear function of covariates. Our model retrofits the workhorse unsupervised dimension reduction device from the machine learning literature – autoencoder neural networks – to incorporate information from covariates along with returns themselves. This delivers estimates of nonlinear conditional exposures and the associated latent factors. Furthermore, our machine learning framework imposes the economic restriction of no-arbitrage. Our autoencoder asset pricing model delivers out-of-sample pricing errors that are far smaller (and generally insignificant) compared to other leading factor models.},

We organize these results based on their primary objectives: estimating expected returns, factors, risk exposures, risk premia, and the stochastic discount factor, as well as model comparison and alpha testing. We also discuss a variety of asymptotic schemes for inference. Our survey is a guide for ﬁnancial economists interested in harnessing modern tools with rigor, robustness, and power to make new asset pricing discoveries, and it highlights directions for future research and methodological advances.},

We ﬁrst discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of ﬁnancial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme ﬂuctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study ﬁnancial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.},
