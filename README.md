# Machine Learning Method Applied on Portfolio Optimization

In this project, instead of using global Mean-Variance Optimization(MVO) strategy with a fixed window for re-allocating assets, I use a more flexible strategy to estimate expected return, covariance matrix and determine when to adjust the portfolio weights.
